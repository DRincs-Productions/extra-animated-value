# Explain ValueImage

So, using ExtraAnimatedValue,, we have an animating bar that knows its current_value and float percentage at any moment in time. Now suppose you wanted one or more image parts of that bar to change depending on those values.  
Maybe you want a bar that is red up until 50% then green for the rest.  
Maybe you want a bar where the thumb turns into a skull when the value drops below 20%.  
Maybe you even yearn for a bar that uses images that dissolve between set pairs between set values.

Well, that is what ValueImage is for.
